# binary_lr_and_sgd_for_airbnb_dataset

In this repo, I built a Binary Logistic Regression and Schoastic Gredient Descent Model that measures the prediction accuracy of avaliability of AIRBNB Amsterdam housings by their price, adjusted price, listing id, minimum_nights and maximum nights.

Then, I compared these two models' performance by their accuracy score, time, and memory consumption.
