# binary_lr_and_sgd_for_airbnb_dataset

In this repo, I built a `Binary Logistic Regression` and `Schoastic Gredient Descent` Models that **predicts the house avaliability of AIRBNB Amsterdam listings.** It is a binary classification task we're deailing in here. While doing so, I've used the below columns in my dataset: 
- Price
- Adjusted price
- Listing id
- Minimum_nights
- maximum nights

Then, I compared these two models' performance by their accuracy score, time, and memory consumption.
